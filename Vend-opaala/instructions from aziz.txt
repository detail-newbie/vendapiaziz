The file data2vend is the finalized file for sending call in vend and creating a sales order , I harcoded product_id
because of the data of opaala(postgres) was not syncronized with Vend API (no table id , restaurant id etc. was in vend for now)

For now token is generated by postman everyday and hardcoded in the data2vend file 

I was working on generating token dynamically(and call it in a variable) every time the code compiles so that no need to create it every time but due to
lack of time , i was unable to do so .

In the req2vend image, data is shown after data2vend.py compiles and it all goes in the "Parked" stage,
Also the product_id (i got from vend)  

You can run and test the SQL Query as given in the data2vend.py on your postgres to check the order_,data_and notification_ tables

Run the code after generating a new token and harcode it in the data2vend.py file in the header section and you will see a new 
Sales created in the system
